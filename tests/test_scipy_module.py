def margins(a):
    """Return a list of the marginal sums of the array `a`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The array for which to compute the marginal sums.

    Returns
    -------
    margsums : list of ndarrays
        A list of length `a.ndim`.  `margsums[k]` is the result
        of summing `a` over all axes except `k`; it has the same
        number of dimensions as `a`, but the length of each axis
        except axis `k` will be 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(2, 6)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
           [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]])

    >>> m0, m1 = margins(a)
    >>> m0
    array([[15],
           [51]])
    >>> m1
    array([[ 6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16]])

    >>> b = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)
    >>> m0, m1, m2 = margins(b)
    >>> m0
    array([[[ 66]],
           [[210]]])

    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],

def expected_freq(observed):
    """
    Compute the expected frequencies from a contingency table.

    Given an n-dimensional contingency table of observed frequencies,
    compute the expected frequencies for the table based on the marginal
    sums under the assumption that the groups associated with each
    dimension are independent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observed : array_like
        The table of observed frequencies.  (While this function can handle
        a 1-D array, that case is trivial.  Generally `observed` is at
        least 2-D.)

    Returns
    -------
    expected : ndarray of float64
        The expected frequencies, based on the marginal sums of the table.
        Same shape as `observed`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.stats.contingency import expected_freq
    >>> observed = np.array([[10, 10, 20],[20, 20, 20]])
